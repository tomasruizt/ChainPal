# Repo-To-Be-Renamend
This repo is a demo application that uses NAME to simplify online shopping. 

### NAME
Have you noticed how hard it is to spend your cryptocurrency on any real product? Some online shops accept Bitcoin, but its very limited. Most of the biggest online shops don't accept cryptocurrencies. The reason is that they are volatile, there is a lot of legal uncertainty. Nobody wants to deal with the complexity that comes with blcokchains.

NAME solves this problem in a very simple way. It accepts cryptocurrency from the online shopper, but it gives online shops what they need, which is cash, and takes a small share for doing so. This way, the retailer has no risk and the shoppper can finally use his crypto like real currency on any online shop.
